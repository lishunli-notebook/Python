       "'5月11日凌晨,第十一轮中美经贸磋商传出结束的消息,据说,在磋商结束后,刘鹤副总理接受了中国记者的集体采访,回答了磋商的有关问题,据陶然笔记了解,有关回答立场坚定,态度坦诚,大气从容,内容详实,还披露了关于近期磋商的一些情况,大致谈了下面几层意思,一是截至第十一轮磋商双方所取得的成果,,二是中方首度公开与美方三个分歧,三是清楚表明加征关税必然触发中方反制,四是表达了对中美关系前景的基本态度,同时透露双方同意继续保持沟通,最重要的消息,其实是第四条,因为美方提到继续增加关税,所以外界一直在猜测,中美磋商是不是破裂了,据了解,从答记者问的内容看,双方团队同意保持沟通,这也表明双方的磋商意愿并未彻底消失,与其说是破裂,不如可以看成是在双方分歧短期无法解决的情况下,磋商进程中发生的插曲,说完声明,再说几点感受,首先,中美一个主要分歧,恐怕还在于双方对,公平,的认知不同,就在这两天,美方频频通过外媒发声,将此轮磋商出现曲折,乃至于重新加征关税的原因,归咎于中方在磋商中,不遵守已谈成的承诺,这个说法经过层层放大,在海外很有市场,传到国内,有些朋友觉得听上去也是那么回事,其实只要稍加留意,就能注意到里面的两处破绽,不难看清这是美方为撇清磋商受阻的责任而设下的舆论议题,第一,磋商尚未完成,没有签署,严格来说,最终签署之前的任何变化都应看作是磋商过程之一,不遵守承诺,的提法其实无从谈起,长于各种谈判技法的美方,对此应该是心知肚明的,第二,美方说中方没有满足美方要求,所以是,不公平,的,但美方对中方诉求只字不提,这难道就公平了,看来在对,公平,的定义上,两边还存在分歧,中方认为相互尊重,平等互利才是公平的,而美方的叙述里,仿佛不满足自己的要求就是不公平的,怎么看这种分歧呢,可以看看一位长者曾对我提过的观点,两国磋商,如果谈出一个两边都不是很满意但又大致能够接受的结果,那就是成功的,执行起来也会顺利一些,如果只是单方面特别满意的协议,而无视另一方的利益和诉求,那么即便是签署了也未必能够落地,而且后患无穷,这也正像我们之前说的,如果某一方仅仅只考虑自己的诉求,以为可以通过极限施压来迫使另一方就范,而忽视了磋商的公平,那么也不是没有不欢而散的可能,其次,中美经贸磋商打打谈谈这种情况很有可能常态化,需要尽快去适应,第十一轮经贸磋商,就是个最典型的例子,磋商这边还谈着呢,那边美方就把2000亿美元中国输美商品的加征关税税率从10,调高到25,还威胁要对3250亿美元中国输美商品加征25,关税,而中方也在第一时间宣布反制,同时强调会对美方举措采取必要反制措施,一边打,一边谈,矛盾吗,很矛盾,但仔细想想,合情合理,谈判,就是在互相试探,互相认识之中找到彼此利益平衡点的过程,现在需要尽快意识到一个问题,打打谈谈的过程必然会面对十分错综复杂的局面,看着刺激人的消息一个接着一个,但我们还是要坚持自己的发展节奏,坚持以开放促改革促发展,推动经济高质量发展,通过改革开放做大国内市场,没点儿定力是不行的,最后,个人觉得,对中美关系的未来,需要有些更多地思考,现在一方面中国必将沿着自己的发展道路坚定不移地走下去,另一方面,美国国内仍有一部分人,习惯于使用,非此即彼,而不是,求同存异,的思维模式来看待中国的发展,我们主要觉得,通过发展可以做出,增量,实现各方的合作共赢,他们有人认为,我们的发展做不出,增量,会触碰他们的,存量,这样一种矛盾,在相当时间相当范围内还将存在,这种矛盾决定了中美之间这种沟通摩擦,存在长期,艰巨,复杂的特点,长期有多长,中美贸易战,打了一年多,仍在继续,会有多艰巨,别的不说,第十一轮磋商已经把这个特点展现出来,会有多复杂,打打谈谈会带来许多难以估算的变量,打中有谈,边谈边打,更遑论其他领域的碰撞和沟通,无论中美间最后能否达成经贸协议,中美之间仍然会有很多不同意见,会有很多分歧,国外很多人,也有国内一部分人,据此认为这将会导致中美出现大范围的摩擦和矛盾,这种可能性是存在的,但也要看到另外一种可能,中美仍然可以蹚出另一条路,一条能够管控分歧,又能够寻找到兼顾彼此利益最大公约数的相处模式,在陶然笔记看来,这正是中方目前在努力推动的一条道路,也是不停推动美方相向而行的根本原因,当中美之间找到某个平衡点的时候,双方的这种密切摩擦或者说碰撞也好,才会逐渐趋于平静,当然,这种设想对不对,还需要事实来检验,现阶段来看,美方包括国内还有相当一部分人对这种前景不理解不认同,因此还需要尝试更多的沟通,运用更多的事实去说服他们,能够谈还是要谈,该打也有能力打,以斗争求团结则团结存,只要我们不忘初心,不忘记斗争的目的是为彼此寻找合适相处模式,那么我们的道理,总有说服人的一天,令狐猫,微信公众号,陶然笔记'"
